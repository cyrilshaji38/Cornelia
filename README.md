# Cornelia
Cornelia, wife of Julius Caesar, was his first bride. She was only thirteen when the two were married (Caesar was fifteen or sixteen at the time) in 84 BC. The union was primarily a political one, as Cornelia's father was Lucio Cornelio Cinna, a four-time consul of Rome. But even still, most report that it was a happy, if not chaotic marriage. Early in their marriage, the dictator of Rome at the time, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, was actually interested in marrying Cornelia and attempted to force Caesar into a divorce that almost resulted in the couple's death. Sulla's ultimatum forced Caesar to flee Rome and become an outlaw for a short period. In the end, Cornelia's dowry was confiscated by Sulla, but their lives were saved thanks to Caesar's mother. Cornelia gave birth to Caesar's only legitimate child, Julia, sometime between 78 and 75 BC. Julia would later marry Pompey the Great to strengthen the First Triumvirate allyship ties. Cornelia and Caesar often spent time apart, as Caesar was busy with military and government responsibilities, and unfortunately Caesar was away when Julia died of what most historians believe to be childbirth when she was 28 in 69 BC. Large funerals for younger women were uncommon, but when Caesar gave Cornelia an ornate funeral, it was widely accepted as a show of his deep love for his wife and his grief over her death.
